&lt;p&gt;“Open Government-Collaboration Conference” as a form of policy discussion for citizen participation, there is a similar but not identical part of the general review conference, called “finding core issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link may be called “topic setting” in the design of citizen participation or deliberative processes. The “Double Diamond” that explains the collaborative meeting in PDIS is also called “confirmation of problem definition”: from the concept of service design, it is hoped that participants can try to use “How Might We?” as a question and challenge. discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what these details are called, the things they are doing are actually similar, and they all hope to allow participants to discuss under a focused problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/%e6%9e%97%e5%9c%8b%e6%98%8e/%e5 %a4%9a%e5%85%83%e5%af%a9%e8%ad%b0%e8%88%87%e5%85%ac%e6%b0%91%e7%a4%be%e6%9c %83%e5%af%a9%e8%ad%b0%e6%b0%91%e4%b8%bb%e6%8c%87%e5%8d%97%e5%b0%8e%e8%ae%80 -%e6%9e%97%e5%9c%8b%e6%98%8e/442060615817584/&quot;&gt;In the Guide to Reviewing Democracy Guide&lt;/a&gt; When Lin Guoming organized the differences in various review forums, he mentioned that “the agenda setting” is oriented: “Some review models, such as citizens In the consensus meeting, participants can develop their own discussion topics, allowing participants to identify the problem and seek solutions. Some can only be discussed from the topics provided by the organizer, such as a citizen jury, or from a set. In the options to express opinions, such as deliberative polls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that the agenda has two concepts: “opening the public and setting up” and “pre-set the organizer”, and the collaborative meeting is difficult to return. The class is any kind. The reason is that most of the start-up of collaborative meetings comes from the public proposal, which is generated from the “pushing point” of the China Development Association’s public policy network participation platform (Join platform). In addition to the Ministry’s own proposal, the current mechanism is usually a proposal by the National Development Council to take the opportunity to reach the threshold of the company, and then enter the PO (Partication Officer, Open Government Contact) monthly meeting to vote, select the topic of the collaborative meeting, and The competent authority for this issue serves as the organizer of the collaborative meeting. Is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;people-or-government-since-the-source-of-the-proposal-starts-from-the-private-sector-the-general-direction-of-the-issue-is-of-course-highly-relevant-to-the-content-of-the-proposal-but-the-proposal-comes-from-the-public-the-executive-is-holding-the-meeting-who-is-going-to-do-the-topic-setting-and-finding-the-core-problem-&quot;&gt;“People” or “Government”? Since the source of the proposal starts from the private sector, the general direction of the issue is of course highly relevant to the content of the proposal, but the proposal comes from the public. The executive is holding the meeting, who is going to do the “topic setting” and “finding the core problem” ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, according to the design process mentioned above for “Double Diamond”, the first half of the collaborative meeting usually begins with a divergent issue inventory, and then summarizes the “core issues” that the participants have shared. Therefore, ideally, this process is at the scene of a collaborative meeting, which is jointly drafted by government agencies and the participating people. For example, the 4th case of the Collaborative Conference: “Improving the concept of driving for all people, to improve the quality of the driving environment of the whole people, and to lift the slow lane of the forbidden machine. The two-stage left turn was lifted. On the day of the meeting, the participants raised their brains and brainstormed the big issues of the proposal, such as the proportion of driving safety and traffic, and the unclear sign of the two-stage Sub-topics such as poor design, and a discussion on the basic consensus. However, there are also many collaborative conferences that emphasize the “finding core issues” during the preparatory period and make adjustments to the agenda before the formal meeting. Taking the collaborative meeting in the second half of 2019 as an example, the process of “problem setting” or “finding the core problem” actually takes place in the preparatory process of the front end, such as “work meeting” and “pre-conference”. . These preparatory processes have public verbatim records that present the discussion context at the meeting. The most important procedure for seeing the pre-conference meeting of the collaborative meeting from many records is that the PDIS team and the main co-organizers confirm the “core issues” discussed on the day of the collaborative meeting. Usually, the “title” of the popular proposal is not the same as the “core issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the setting of the “core issue” from the meeting to the pre-preparation period seems to reflect that the organizer has the power to set the agenda before the meeting. Why do you need such intervention? Although the ideal of collaborative meetings is to follow the shape of “Double Diamond,” it is actually difficult to concentrate all the links in a half-day period. Therefore, the Collaborative Conference developed the “pre-existing interview” and “writing the topic manual”. The first work of the first Diamond was done as much as possible, which is equivalent to the mentality map before the meeting. The inventory is complete. I hope that at the meeting, I can focus on the “core issues” in the context of information synchronization and confirmation of disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-core-is-not-your-core&quot;&gt;My core is not your core&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as my current limited observations are concerned, live discussions are not always able to follow the “core issues” that the PDIS team and the organizers expect, participants It is still possible to emphasize the focus of his original intention. However, the tool list designed with the core problem and the small table leader during the group discussion can really make the scope and focus of the discussion more biased towards the “core problem” that the organizer expects. This is a good or bad practice, and what to do depends on the positioning of the collaborative meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you develop your core questions, you may have a situation where “my core is not your core.” For example, the proposal on the Join platform in 2018 (the 38th case of the Collaborative Conference): “Improve the commemorative day and the implementation of the festival in paragraph 5, paragraph 2, paragraph 4, add the fifth paragraph to add police and firefighters to In the process of the Collaborative Meeting, the Police Day and the Fire Festival Day have issued a “return problem, starting from the cause of overwork”. Although we can claim that this is the “core of the problem”, we should broadly find and find out The “fundamental” solution, but the proponents believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdis.nat. gov.tw/zh-tw/blog/%e8%ad%a6%e6%b6%88%e4%bc%91%e5%81%87%e5%8f%af%e8%a1%8c%e5%97 %8e-%e5%8d%94%e4%bd%9c%e6%9c%83%e8%ad%b0%e7%99%bc%e6%83%b3%e7%9b%b8%e9%97% 9c%e9%85%8d%e5%a5%97/&quot;&gt;“the meeting should not discuss the issue of overwork, should focus on the feasibility of a day off, let the grassroots staff feel a sense.”&lt;/a&gt; shows that he still hopes that his proposed solution is the focus of the focused discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-core-issue-is-not-rigid&quot;&gt;The core issue is not rigid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part of the collaborative issue seems to be “core problem” first set, but at the site of the collaborative meeting, members of the PDIS team will play in the collaborative meeting The function of hosting and recording, if it is found that the participants’ motivation for discussion is not on the core problem originally set, will also adjust the core problem immediately according to the situation of the mental map and the content of the live speech. Before the collaborative meeting was held, the ministry also conducted interviews and data collection based on the problem awareness of the proposal. The live and live broadcast of the collaborative meeting will also use the original title of the proposal as the name of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the collaborative meeting, the Informed session before the discussion begins, the first report of the sponsor will be arranged to remind all participants of the starting point of the collaborative meeting. The “core problem” set by the data collection and consolidation in advance is the driving force for the organisers to guide, but it is not necessarily the case that each case can be carried out in the direction of the pre-judgment. Trying to balance the “core issues” that different stakeholders care about is the most difficult and important task for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;significance-of-citizen-participation&quot;&gt;Significance of Citizen Participation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only the 38th case of the above-mentioned collaborative meeting has the process of “returning more structural problems, more extensive inventory and based on factual information, and finding the core of the problem”. In the case of collaborative meetings, there are opinions or solutions proposed from the public, and the retrospective process of exploring the core issues to the more advanced structural system. From the perspective of the public, it seems that the government does not directly correspond to his needs. However, from the perspective of the executive authorities, “citizen participation” does not mean that the executive authorities should accept 100% of the public’s recommendations. After all, the 5,000 people attached to the Join platform proposal do not necessarily agree with every point of the proposal, but only agree with the problems and difficulties that are pointed out behind them. If the collaborative meeting can really become a routine operation mechanism, encourage more administrative agencies to take the initiative to organize meetings to convene multiple stakeholders and promote communication and dialogue. The agenda must consider the necessity of the position and opinions of the main and co-organizers. It will be greatly improved. Moreover, the administrative organs related to the issue are equivalent to the natural stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDIS team encourages the executive to first expose the scope of the policy’s feasible solution. In this way, it is more likely to deal with the issue and achieve the desired effect. Since the position and understanding of the policy and the level of familiarity between the executive authorities and the public are different, it is necessary to find the direction of the agenda that is considered and pragmatic. Because the proposal is too far away from reality, or it can only be implemented according to the people’s literal suggestions, it may face difficulties in the short term, and the scope of the solution is not helpful for improving the issue itself. In conclusion, the PDIS team implements the “open government” business. In the process of implementing the open government, we must pay attention to the original intention of the public proposal, except that it is relatively neutral in the process of hosting (relative to the main department). Role, but also must stand in the perspective of the executive, let the public sector think that “citizen participation” is not so far away from them, “collaboration meeting” is a platform for mutual understanding, not just unilateral, passive acceptance of demand Roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break out of the proposal’s people and the government’s dichotomy. If the results of the collaborative meeting are expected to become the direction of policy participation, the internal position of the organization will be aligned and the scope of the solution will be the necessary process, by opening the space and The dialogue among the people and the stimulation of more constructive opinions and solutions are the results that the collaborative meeting hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the space for discussion from the popular proposal, and then let the executives think about the setting of a meeting until the on-the-spot opinion was reached. The public and private sector participants discussed and together they were not satisfied but could not The accepted process of dissolving is a fun and unique aspect of collaborative meetings as one of the “citizen participation” or “deliberative meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>許恩恩</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="開放政府" /><summary type="html">The government is not unilaterally accepting the role of the proposal, so the collaborative meeting has a unique process of &quot;finding the core problem.&quot;</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/30f0a1f9648d12115f8519f870fb84b9489642cb.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/30f0a1f9648d12115f8519f870fb84b9489642cb.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Talents don’t get lost, only circulated</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%B5%81%E5%A4%B1-%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Talents don't get lost, only circulated" /><published>2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%B5%81%E5%A4%B1-%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%B5%81%E5%A4%B1-%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0/">&lt;p&gt;🛰 This April, the Talent Circulation Alliance (TCA), jointly sponsored by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was officially established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 My office (Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) was also invited to provide technical services for the online public consultation conducted by TCA. Similar to the Digital Dialogue series jointly organized by AIT and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the pol.is system has been used to construct a dialogue platform (📲website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tca.talksto.tw&quot;&gt;tca.talksto.tw&lt;/a&gt;) to enable participants interested in this topic to express opinions and brainstorm ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Brain drain is regarded by many people as a serious national issue. Yet, when we consider the example of Morris Chang, founder of TSMC, we can see that as long as a conducive environment and system exist, talents do not just flow in one direction but rather in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 The experience sharing, cultural integration and social interaction promoted by a transnational mobility process enabled the value of talent circulation flow into all levels of society. Of course, teleworking arises with 4G and 5G technologies, further enabling mutual exchange of talented people at speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 TCA aims to cultivate a talent pool that possesses professional competence, international vision and digital technology expertise. Four goals have been proposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔭 First, recreating a success story for Taiwan’s industry in a digital age. In fact, one of the key reasons that Taiwan’s industry has been able to develop to its current state is because of the repatriation of talents who have studied or worked abroad. As long as this story can continue, the circulation of talents in Taiwan will surely extend into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💼 Second, promoting the circulation of talent among like-minded economies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎫 Third, building a local talent pool and laying a foundation for Taiwan’s transformation into an innovation-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 Fourth, enhancing Taiwan’s international visibility through professional exchange in the private sector, academic circles, and international NGOs, expanding Taiwan’s participation in and contribution to global solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📖 In addition, TCA will summarize the key content of the above public consultation into the “Talents Program Big League Plan White Paper”, which will be incorporated into the annual “Taiwan White Paper” of the American Chamber of Commerce. It will target the administrative, regulatory and legal barriers to talent circulation and propose concrete and pragmatic solutions as a reference for subsequent governments to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 In September this year, the “Expat Insider” survey released by the world’s largest foreigner community “InterNations” indicated that Taiwan is considered by foreigners all over the world as the “best place to move to and work in”. It came first in a list of 68 countries and this is the second time that Taiwan has won this award. This confirms that Taiwan indeed possesses excellent conditions for attracting talents from around the world and can definitely hold its own in the global talent cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Taiwan is considered by foreigners all over the world as the “best place to move to and work in.”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d2d9c7bf3088d67c5150e2e658a5dcae2f3a6e66.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d2d9c7bf3088d67c5150e2e658a5dcae2f3a6e66.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sharing not only a Common Origin, but also a Common Future</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sharing not only a Common Origin, but also a Common Future" /><published>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/">&lt;p&gt;🌍 Over the past three years, I have led a delegation to participate in the “Social Enterprise World Forum” every year. This year was no exception. The conference was held in turn on each of the five continents. In October, myself and 45 partners from all over the world went to Ethiopia in Africa to share Taiwan’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔬 For many people, the African continent seems far away. But in this forum, I have seen that the challenges faced by our friends in Africa are the same problems that Taiwan has faced. For our African friends, our experience is precious. The “$1 Fast Screening for Tuberculosis” treatment from WellGen Medical in Taiwan is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😷 At present, the main detection method for tuberculosis is the analysis of sputum, collected by the hospital, through a microscope by an laboratory technician. This practice is not only time- and labor-consuming, but also makes it difficult to accurately confirm the results. The global infection cases are still high. In 2018, more than 250,000 children and 1 million adults died of tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏥 To this end, the automatic microscopy system developed by WellGen Medical, combined with AI image recognition, can greatly reduce the cost of tests, in addition to improving case detection sensitivity and solving the issue of insufficient medical staff in remote areas. Take the example of the WHO-recommended xPert detection tool, where each use costs almost US$10. Through this new system, the quick tuberculosis screening costs US$1 each time. At present, WellGen Medical’s revenue is gradually expanding, and they are already planning on deploying the system worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇹🇼 The practice of the Taiwanese government has also struck a chord locally. Before, the CEO of Skills for U, Huang Weixiang, proposed in the Executive Yuan’s Youth Advisory Committee that after the team received the award from the national vocational skills competition, they can also participate in on the spot education. Not only will they be cheered in the National Day parade, but they will also be self-sufficient. At the “Youth Participation in Innovation” session, I explained how the youth lead our policies. Eleni Zaude Gabre-Madhin, an economist on the panel, was impressed. After the meeting, Eleni invited me to visit blueSpace, her co-working space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍹 Three years ago, Eleni founded blueMoon, Ethiopia’s first innovation incubator that combines agricultural enterprises and youth development while striving to train outstanding young entrepreneurs aged 15 to 29, as an investment in agricultural improvement and innovation. BlueSpace is a service provided by blueMoon. “How can we spread African food to the whole world?” When I arrived, many young innovators were discussing the brand marketing of African agriculture. I received a warm response when I brought up the case of successfully converting Taiwanese bubble tea into various products and how it became an example of a creative global cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👣 The unearthing of the famous hominid fossil “Lucy” in Ethiopia has made East Africa widely regarded as the origin of mankind. I believe that discussing social innovation in our ancestral continent is indeed of great significance. The descendants of Lucy stepped out of Africa and opened up human civilization. Just like many pioneers on the road to social innovation — they have become an example for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Discussing social innovation in our ancestral continent is indeed of great significance.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ce59c16b3a62d6c85908d7370e1fe69664dacd0.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ce59c16b3a62d6c85908d7370e1fe69664dacd0.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Can’t Stop This Party</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can't Stop This Party" /><published>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82/">&lt;p&gt;🔽 The “Can’t Stop This Party” is holding its founding meeting this afternoon. In recognition of the idea that joy promotes generational integration and realizes freedom and democracy, I sent a flower basket based on catmint as a token of my blessing and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 More than 20 years ago, several young people put forward the concept of “Happy &amp;amp; Hope,” in an attempt to dilute the tragic atmosphere accumulated in the development of democracy, and to open up more communication and understanding between generations and ethnic groups through different means. The results are well known: They have turned politics around in Taipei, and further, Taiwan’s fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥭 Today, the so-called “Dried Mango” reminds us that we are indeed facing formidable social and environmental challenges. For many friends, caution and seriousness are essential. There’s nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌳 But, a brave, confident, and undivided Taiwan is the premise of all answers. In other words, if we get caught in the internal conflict and stop listening to each other, we might risk losing the liberal democracy we cherish today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, any way to promote dialogue and build consensus deserves encouragement and experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to the Participation Officers of the National Development Council, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Construction Commission, there were also a representative from IISI International, Inc.; Johnson Liang, the co-founder of the Cofacts project; and a meteorologist, Dr. Chi-Ming Peng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 It is worth noting that the main contents of this seminar include Taiwan’s promotion of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the use of open-access materials to improve the quality of life, countering internet disinformation, and expanding citizen participation in public policy, and so on. Every item is the result of cooperation between government, business, and citizen communities. In other words, the focus of the discussion is not just “what we did”, but “how we did it together”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Taking social innovation as an example, I shared the story of the development of the Innovation Center; the social issues dealt with by the winners of the Presidential Hackathon winners of the past two years and the implementation of sustainable development goals; opening up a weekly Office Hour as well as touring town halls, minimizing the information gap between urban and rural areas;  and using the “Social Innovation Lab” to really grasp issues immediately by responding to social issues encountered by our friends, and letting social innovations drive regulatory innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎙️ In addition, thanks to the arrangements of the Representative Office, I took separate and in-depth interviews on the same day with the Thai Public Broadcasting Service, Chulalongkorn University, A DAY, Post Today, and Workpoint. It is readily apparent that Taiwan’s practical experience has received attention from across Thai society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 The section on citizen participation was presented by the Ministry of Foreign Affair’s Public Affairs section chief, Mr. Qian Muxian, and the Public Construction Commission committee member Mr. Zhang Zhaoqi. The presentation opened with the government’s four key values of “Transparency, Participation, Accountability, and Inclusion”, and then explaining the functions of the NDC Public Policy Network Participation Platform (JOIN), and then continuing to the inter-departmental openings of the government liaison system. “Requesting a National Airborne Service Corps at Hengchun Airport” and  “Using Tax-Income Software Leads to Blowups” are two examples of the network process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 They introduced the inter-departmental participation officers networks; how to clarify petitioner’ core demands; interviews with multiple stakeholders to collect opinions weekly; inviting service users to join in the process and participate in actual planning, and completing the meeting process and publicly responding to specific procedures to find feasible and innovative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 “Taiwan Can Help” is the core message of the government in recent years. This is not just a slogan, but a dependable experience and resource that can contribute internationally. With help from all sectors of Taiwan, I’m glad to see that this Bangkok trip proves yet again: Taiwan Can Help.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">The focus of the discussion is not just “what we did”, but “how we did it together”.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66f950eecd95b45469cbb174f3f7d4dee281c484.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66f950eecd95b45469cbb174f3f7d4dee281c484.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">All for one and one for all</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All for one and one for all" /><published>2019-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗽 When I was in New York in September, I befriended &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kelbayar&quot;&gt;Kareem Elbayar&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership manager of the United Nations (UN). He introduced me to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ According to UN estimates, more than 130 million people from 42 countries worldwide are in need of humanitarian assistance this year. The cost is conservatively estimated to be US$21.9 billion. As of June this year, more than 70.80 million people have been displaced worldwide, an unprecedented historical high. In the presence of a huge and complex humanitarian crisis, a major challenge for all of us lies in how to provide immediate relief in the most critical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 Therefore, the HDX team decided to use “data for humanitarian assistance” to help define common standards for information, so that colleagues who work in humanitarian assistance everywhere can use the same tools to assess different situations. For the humanitarian aid work, which region and when do you need resources? A minor inaccuracy can lead to a significant miscalculation. By having complete information, we can ensure fast and accurate decisions to meet the actual needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 Currently, HDX has published more than 10,000 data sets in 250 regions around the world, which can be shared and accessed by everyone. In addition, HDX is committed to the development of Predictive Analytics for humanitarian aids. Everyone is invited to review the past and present data of the same region so that potential problems can be understood in advance to prevent crises before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 Using the same concept, Taiwan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.taiwan.gov.tw/index_en.aspx&quot;&gt;Civil IoT platform&lt;/a&gt; adopts the internationally standardized SensorThings API. For water resources, air quality, or even disaster prevention information, the world’s academic researchers and hands-on workers can get more comprehensive help through these openly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📒 Taiwan ranks among the best in the world in terms of transparency of government information. For example, the complete historical data of the government’s electronic procurement network has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gazette2.nat.gov.tw/EG_FileManager/eguploadpub/eg025179/ch06/type2/gov51/num12/Eg.htm&quot;&gt;made public to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt; this year, though this is not the case in most countries. Therefore, in the Presidential Hackathon in July this year, we collaborated with the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP). Many participating teams from various countries were inspired by the experiences of Taiwan for more good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/28/build-better-build-right-a-new-tool-for-sustainable-climate-resilient-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;CoST&lt;/a&gt; team led by Minister of Transparency of Honduras is actively using procurement materials to make environmental impact assessments more transparent and to resolve conflicts in economic development and public land use. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/23/cartelogy-a-tool-for-fair-competition-and-corruption-free-public-procurement-in-malaysia/&quot;&gt;Mentadak&lt;/a&gt; team from Malaysia also uses open procurement data standards to identify conflicts of interest in the procurement process. This reduces the possibility of fraud and helps good manufacturers participate in public construction. Both teams won the hackathon at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The success of Taiwan’s experience does not lie in the amount of information, but in the core spirit of social innovation - “all for one and one for all”. Through Data Collaboratives, we are contributing along with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">The complete historical data of Taiwan government’s electronic procurement network has been made public to academic researchers this year, though this is not the case in most countries.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6702fb68a013249c4482b34d60792fdebc43b342.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6702fb68a013249c4482b34d60792fdebc43b342.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Civil servants can also serve as “pro bono directorates” for international nonprofit organizations</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Civil servants can also serve as “pro bono directorates” for international nonprofit organizations" /><published>2019-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB%E3%80%8C%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B%E3%80%8D</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗳️ At the end of the National Day holiday, I was in Osaka, Japan, attending Devcon, a conference initiated to improve community governance and research new features. Vitalik Buterin, who is a member on the RadicalxChange Foundation Council, and also the founder of Ethereum shared with us his experience with “Quadratic Voting” in the Presidential Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Some readers may have never heard of Ethereum or Vitalik. But that doesn’t matter — the focus of this article is to share my legal basis for serving on two nonprofit organizations , as something every civil servant can reference: RadicalxChange in the United States, and the Digital Future Society in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ First, according to Article 14(1), Article 14-2(1), and Article 14-3 of the Civil Service Act, a civil servant, stipulated by the law, may not concurrently hold a public employment or business; in the case of adjunct businesses or positions for nonprofit organizations, whether or not they are paid, permission should be requested from the service agency. In my case, it is necessary to obtain consent from the Premier of the Executive Yuan beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 As stipulated under Article 3 of the “Regulation Permitting the Paid Employment of Civil Servants in Non-Profit Businesses or Groups”, the nominated non-profit organizations must be “legally registered or filed and established with the authorizing department”. The problem is that when it comes to an “international” non-profit organization, the organization may not necessarily be registered or established in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Logically, the reasoning that “something is impermissible just because it is neither stipulated by nor has precedence under the law” is inconsistent with the government’s ethos of encouraging the innovative spirit of civil servants. For this reason, I have consulted my colleagues who specialize in the relevant law and submitted a confirmation request to the Ministry of Civil Service. The Ministry then indicated that there is no restriction that a non-profit organization must be registered in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🆗 As stipulated by Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the regulation, if the part-time job has a negative impact on their work, damages the image of the government or civil servant, has the potential for malpractice, or is incompatible with their duty, the organization shall not grant the permission. It is worth noting that although only the “paid” part is specified here, I still consider these two “unpaid” positions with the same criteria, confirming that not only do they not have the above concerns, but also help connect my domestic work with international orgnizations with the approval of the Premier. Moreover, I use my time outside of work to perform these two “unpaid” positions and give priority strictly to the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚀 In summary, considering these two “unpaid” positions, which are directly related to social innovation and open government, and with the consent from the Premier, I will continue to participate in RadicalxChange and the Digital Future Society as a member of the board. Along with the activities to increase the opportunity to promote our innovations in related fields globally, I also hope that this experience can be used as a case for Taiwan’s civil servants to invoke and refer to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">These two “unpaid” positions are directly related to social innovation and open government.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f50428cabfed29d9ff4add66e64ef83e8e167b41.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f50428cabfed29d9ff4add66e64ef83e8e167b41.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy" /><published>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗺 Democracy improves as more people participate. And digital technology remains one of the best ways to improve participation — as long as the focus is on finding common ground and creating consensus, not division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 These are lessons Taiwan has taken to heart in recent years, with the government and the tech community partnering to create online platforms and other digital initiatives that allow everyday citizens to propose and express their opinion on policy reforms. Today, Taiwan is crowdsourcing democracy to create a more responsive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌻 Fittingly, this movement, which today aims to increase government transparency, was born in a moment of national outrage over a lack of openness and accountability in politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 On March 18, 2014, hundreds of young activists, most of them college students, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-legislature/taiwan-students-occupy-legislature-over-china-trade-deal-idUSBREA2I04S20140319&quot;&gt;occupied Taiwan’s legislature&lt;/a&gt; to express their profound opposition to a new trade pact with Beijing then under consideration, as well as the secretive manner in which it was being pushed through Parliament by the Kuomintang, the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔍 Catalyzing what came to be known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/02/activist-legacy-of-taiwan-s-sunflower-movement-pub-76966&quot;&gt;Sunflower Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the protesters demanded that the pact be scraped and that the government institute a more transparent ratification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚧 The occupation, which drew widespread public support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/students-prepare-to-end-occupation-of-taiwans-legislature/?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised greater legislative oversight of the trade pact. (To this day, the pact has yet to be approved by Taiwan’s legislature.) A poll released after the occupation, however, showed that 76 percent of the nation remained dissatisfied with the Kuomintang government, illustrating the crisis of trust caused by the trade deal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 To heal this rift and communicate better with everyday citizens, the administration reached out to a group of civic-minded hackers and coders, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://g0v.asia/&quot;&gt;g0v&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “gov-zero”), who had been seeking to improve government transparency through the creation of open-source tools. The organization had come to the attention of the government during the Sunflower occupation, when g0v hackers had worked closely with the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 In December 2014, Jaclyn Tsai, a government minister focused on digital technology, attended a g0v-sponsored hackathon and proposed the establishment of a neutral platform where various online communities could exchange policy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 Several contributors from g0v responded by partnering with the government to start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vtaiwan.tw&quot;&gt;vTaiwan&lt;/a&gt; platform in 2015. VTaiwan (which stands for “virtual Taiwan”) brings together representatives from the public, private and social sectors to debate policy solutions to problems primarily related to the digital economy. Since it began, vTaiwan has tackled 30 issues, relying on a mix of online debate and face-to-face discussions with stakeholders. Though the government is not obligated to follow vTaiwan’s recommendations (a policy that may soon change), the group’s work often leads to concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 VTaiwan partly relies on a unique digital tool known as Pol.is to ensure its crowdsourced policy debates remain civil and reach consensus. Using Pol.is, any vTaiwan participant can post a comment about the topic or policy being discussed. Crucially, other users cannot directly reply to these statements, which reduces the likelihood of trolling and abuse. Instead, they can click “agree,” “disagree” or “pass/unsure” on each comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Using real-time machine learning, Pol.is analyzes all the votes on the comments to produce an interactive map that groups like-minded participants together in relation to other, differently minded users. The map lays bare the gaps between various groups — as well as any areas of agreement. Ideally, this incentivizes people to post comments that attract more supporters, creating a path toward consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 VTaiwan has been used to solve a number of particularly thorny digital policy problems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b&quot;&gt;In 2015&lt;/a&gt;, it helped break an impasse over how best to regulate Uber, which had arrived in Taiwan two years earlier prompting opposition from taxi drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 In 2016, hundreds of ordinary citizens using the platform managed within a few weeks to come up with new regulations for online liquor sales, after multiyear discussions among business and social groups had broken down. And in 2018, vTaiwan helped to create new regulations for the platform economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Taiwan also relies on another civic engagement platform called Join, this one maintained entirely by the government. Though similar to vTaiwan in that it uses Pol.is to create consensus, Join tackles matters beyond the digital economy, such as vacancy taxes and drug prescriptions for animals. Compared to the hundreds of thousands who have debated issues on vTaiwan, Join’s website has hosted 10.6 million unique visitors — almost half of Taiwan’s population — since it began in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Together, vTaiwan and Join are opening up more direct lines of communication between Taiwan’s government and its citizens, producing tremendous benefits for the former. Officials are exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking, while identifying core public service demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 The &lt;a href=&quot;https://presidential-hackathon.taiwan.gov.tw/en/&quot;&gt;Presidential Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; is yet another tech initiative bringing Taiwan’s public, private and social sectors together to solve urgent problems. At the event, the first of which was held last year, teams of hackers — composed of either private citizens or government workers — compete to design the most innovative improvements to the nation’s public services. Instead of prize money, the best teams receive a promise from the government that it will apply their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖ One of the top teams in this year’s hackathon included officials from the Judicial Yuan, the judicial branch of the Taiwanese government. The team developed two digital tools to make the nation’s judicial system more legible and transparent for everyday Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚔 Drunken driving is an issue of broad public concern in Taiwan. And in recent years, the differing sentences handed out to drivers involved in high-profile accidents have led to public confusion about why some punishments can be so light compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔧 One of the digital tools developed by the Judicial Yuan team addresses this confusion by giving the public a better sense of why punishments can differ for the same crime. Any user can simply enter in the relevant data for a hypothetical drunken-driving offense, such as blood alcohol concentration and the type of vehicle involved. The application then lists the appropriate penalties for the case, while also showing sentences from real-world drunken-driving cases that are similar to the one described. (The team analyzed over 50,000 verdicts from previous drunken-driving offenses to create the tool.) In this way, users get a better understanding of how slight changes in, for example, blood alcohol concentration can lead to radically different penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 In the closing speech of this year’s Presidential Hackathon, President Tsai Ing-wen encouraged government officials to embrace a hacker spirit as they work to meet the public’s needs. “Do it bravely; dare to make mistakes,” she said. In Taiwan, digital technology is boosting civic dialogue and infusing government with the spirit of social innovation. By giving everyone a voice, Taiwan is strengthening its democracy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In Taiwan, online platforms powered by artificial intelligence are giving citizens a chance to have their say — while keeping the trolls at bay.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan" /><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/">&lt;p&gt;🆕 I would like to share with you the good news: The 3rd Asia-Pacific Social Enterprise Summit will be held in Taoyuan in early May 2020. The organizer is Impact Hub Taipei, with authorization by the SME Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 The last two summits were held in Taichung and Kaohsiung respectively. Not only did they attract thousands of highly enthusiastic and experienced people from all over the world, but also through the continuous hosting of the summit, the summits gave participants from other countries the opportunity to learn about contributions from Taiwan. At the same time, the summits gave the domestic population with the same ambitions and hope to have a platform for communications and discussions, so as to solve specific social issues and to promote sustainable development through innovative business models and business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Of course, the most important aspect of hosting an international event is the local connections. In late September, MOEA colleagues and I, accompanying the organizers of the summit, met with Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan to seek administrative support from the city government. In addition to the promise of the Mayor Cheng regarding the support of the projects related to the venue of the summit, transportation connection, and enterprise connection, Mayor Cheng very efficiently formed an inter-departmental coordination group. He also introduced in detail the government’s assistance to the social enterprises, and suggested that the organizers could include more local elements of Taoyuan in the peripheral activities of the summit such as “social enterprise tours” and “social enterprise market.” It is worth expecting these elements in next year’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 Moreover, in order to promote the 17 sustainable development goals and implement the overall policy objectives of “friendly and kind, suitable to live and work,” Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the sustainable development goals in the region with actual data and cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 In fact, according to the statistics indicators of the counties and cities of the Ministry of the Interior in 2018, the total birth rate of Taoyuan City is not only the highest in the six municipalities, but also one of the highest in the country, second only to the Lianjiang County. In addition, Taoyuan is the city with the highest net migration rate in Taiwan and the highest rate of social increase. These figures not only represent the achievements of Taoyuan in recent years, but also the foundation for promoting social innovation in the future. We look forward to Taoyuan’s contributions as a demonstration for all counties and cities in Taiwan, so we can flourish together toward the goals of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、黃子維</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the SDGs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Safeguarding Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safeguarding Taiwan" /><published>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;🛡️ Taiwan is home to more than 23 million people. One point on which all agree is the importance of safeguarding national security. In the past, related policymaking was the exclusive domain of the government. Today, the people can help shape this critically important process by participating in the on-going &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The Digital Dialogues are part of the AIT@40 campaign launched by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Digital Innovation Space in an effort to help digitally democratize the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  They are, according to AIT, “the first of its kind anywhere in the world  – a public forum to discuss the results of an artificial intelligence-enabled digital dialogue between a foreign mission and a local community on how to tackle a pressing foreign policy challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 They comprise four online public consultations this year on Taiwan’s role in global society, April; U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial exchanges, June; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, August; and people-to-people ties, November.  As AIT Director Brent Christensen said, “AIT is interested in what you, the public, have to say on these matters.  We hope these dialogues will provide valuable insights that AIT can put into practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛩️ Those interested in learning more about why Taiwan is purchasing advanced weapons like the F-16 C/D Block 70 fighters and M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as the reasons for closer U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, must take part in any discussions on the bilateral security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important security ally and partner. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan vote of support. It states that the U.S. government should provide “defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.” This ensures the U.S. supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining robust self-defense capabilities while consolidating national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ Since 2008, the U.S. has sold defensive weapons worth more than US$24 billion to Taiwan—an amount underscoring the strength of two-way ties. In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔜 AIT has said the AIT@40 Digital Dialogues for 2019 are not the end of the road for this revolutionary participatory policymaking initiative. They intend to continue to engage in future digital dialogues on the U.S-Taiwan relationship, including for the drafting of the Talent Circulation Alliance White Paper, which will become part of AmCham’s influential annual White Paper. Keep a close eye on this potential-laden public-private partnership for the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the Digital Dialogues give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f7f00652cc6dbed3c8f0e473dc2791fcb8339a.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f7f00652cc6dbed3c8f0e473dc2791fcb8339a.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
