&lt;p&gt;💡 My office (Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) was also invited to provide technical services for the online public consultation conducted by TCA. Similar to the Digital Dialogue series jointly organized by AIT and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the pol.is system has been used to construct a dialogue platform (📲website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tca.talksto.tw&quot;&gt;tca.talksto.tw&lt;/a&gt;) to enable participants interested in this topic to express opinions and brainstorm ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Brain drain is regarded by many people as a serious national issue. Yet, when we consider the example of Morris Chang, founder of TSMC, we can see that as long as a conducive environment and system exist, talents do not just flow in one direction but rather in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 The experience sharing, cultural integration and social interaction promoted by a transnational mobility process enabled the value of talent circulation flow into all levels of society. Of course, teleworking arises with 4G and 5G technologies, further enabling mutual exchange of talented people at speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 TCA aims to cultivate a talent pool that possesses professional competence, international vision and digital technology expertise. Four goals have been proposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔭 First, recreating a success story for Taiwan’s industry in a digital age. In fact, one of the key reasons that Taiwan’s industry has been able to develop to its current state is because of the repatriation of talents who have studied or worked abroad. As long as this story can continue, the circulation of talents in Taiwan will surely extend into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💼 Second, promoting the circulation of talent among like-minded economies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎫 Third, building a local talent pool and laying a foundation for Taiwan’s transformation into an innovation-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 Fourth, enhancing Taiwan’s international visibility through professional exchange in the private sector, academic circles, and international NGOs, expanding Taiwan’s participation in and contribution to global solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📖 In addition, TCA will summarize the key content of the above public consultation into the “Talents Program Big League Plan White Paper”, which will be incorporated into the annual “Taiwan White Paper” of the American Chamber of Commerce. It will target the administrative, regulatory and legal barriers to talent circulation and propose concrete and pragmatic solutions as a reference for subsequent governments to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 In September this year, the “Expat Insider” survey released by the world’s largest foreigner community “InterNations” indicated that Taiwan is considered by foreigners all over the world as the “best place to move to and work in”. It came first in a list of 68 countries and this is the second time that Taiwan has won this award. This confirms that Taiwan indeed possesses excellent conditions for attracting talents from around the world and can definitely hold its own in the global talent cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Taiwan is considered by foreigners all over the world as the “best place to move to and work in.”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d2d9c7bf3088d67c5150e2e658a5dcae2f3a6e66.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d2d9c7bf3088d67c5150e2e658a5dcae2f3a6e66.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sharing not only a Common Origin, but also a Common Future</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sharing not only a Common Origin, but also a Common Future" /><published>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90-%E6%9B%B4%E8%A6%81%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/">&lt;p&gt;🌍 Over the past three years, I have led a delegation to participate in the “Social Enterprise World Forum” every year. This year was no exception. The conference was held in turn on each of the five continents. In October, myself and 45 partners from all over the world went to Ethiopia in Africa to share Taiwan’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔬 For many people, the African continent seems far away. But in this forum, I have seen that the challenges faced by our friends in Africa are the same problems that Taiwan has faced. For our African friends, our experience is precious. The “$1 Fast Screening for Tuberculosis” treatment from WellGen Medical in Taiwan is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😷 At present, the main detection method for tuberculosis is the analysis of sputum, collected by the hospital, through a microscope by an laboratory technician. This practice is not only time- and labor-consuming, but also makes it difficult to accurately confirm the results. The global infection cases are still high. In 2018, more than 250,000 children and 1 million adults died of tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏥 To this end, the automatic microscopy system developed by WellGen Medical, combined with AI image recognition, can greatly reduce the cost of tests, in addition to improving case detection sensitivity and solving the issue of insufficient medical staff in remote areas. Take the example of the WHO-recommended xPert detection tool, where each use costs almost US$10. Through this new system, the quick tuberculosis screening costs US$1 each time. At present, WellGen Medical’s revenue is gradually expanding, and they are already planning on deploying the system worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇹🇼 The practice of the Taiwanese government has also struck a chord locally. Before, the CEO of Skills for U, Huang Weixiang, proposed in the Executive Yuan’s Youth Advisory Committee that after the team received the award from the national vocational skills competition, they can also participate in on the spot education. Not only will they be cheered in the National Day parade, but they will also be self-sufficient. At the “Youth Participation in Innovation” session, I explained how the youth lead our policies. Eleni Zaude Gabre-Madhin, an economist on the panel, was impressed. After the meeting, Eleni invited me to visit blueSpace, her co-working space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍹 Three years ago, Eleni founded blueMoon, Ethiopia’s first innovation incubator that combines agricultural enterprises and youth development while striving to train outstanding young entrepreneurs aged 15 to 29, as an investment in agricultural improvement and innovation. BlueSpace is a service provided by blueMoon. “How can we spread African food to the whole world?” When I arrived, many young innovators were discussing the brand marketing of African agriculture. I received a warm response when I brought up the case of successfully converting Taiwanese bubble tea into various products and how it became an example of a creative global cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👣 The unearthing of the famous hominid fossil “Lucy” in Ethiopia has made East Africa widely regarded as the origin of mankind. I believe that discussing social innovation in our ancestral continent is indeed of great significance. The descendants of Lucy stepped out of Africa and opened up human civilization. Just like many pioneers on the road to social innovation — they have become an example for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Discussing social innovation in our ancestral continent is indeed of great significance.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ce59c16b3a62d6c85908d7370e1fe69664dacd0.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ce59c16b3a62d6c85908d7370e1fe69664dacd0.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Can’t Stop This Party</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can't Stop This Party" /><published>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%BE%97%E5%85%B6%E6%AD%A1%E6%A8%82/">&lt;p&gt;🔽 The “Can’t Stop This Party” is holding its founding meeting this afternoon. In recognition of the idea that joy promotes generational integration and realizes freedom and democracy, I sent a flower basket based on catmint as a token of my blessing and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 More than 20 years ago, several young people put forward the concept of “Happy &amp;amp; Hope,” in an attempt to dilute the tragic atmosphere accumulated in the development of democracy, and to open up more communication and understanding between generations and ethnic groups through different means. The results are well known: They have turned politics around in Taipei, and further, Taiwan’s fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥭 Today, the so-called “Dried Mango” reminds us that we are indeed facing formidable social and environmental challenges. For many friends, caution and seriousness are essential. There’s nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌳 But, a brave, confident, and undivided Taiwan is the premise of all answers. In other words, if we get caught in the internal conflict and stop listening to each other, we might risk losing the liberal democracy we cherish today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, any way to promote dialogue and build consensus deserves encouragement and experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 That is where the hope is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">A brave, confident, and undivided Taiwan is the premise of all answers.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd6de5956479ae028b84d4b3c6e9196d9bf766f1.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd6de5956479ae028b84d4b3c6e9196d9bf766f1.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Taiwan Can Help in Bangkok</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Taiwan-Can-Help-%E5%9C%A8%E6%9B%BC%E8%B0%B7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taiwan Can Help in Bangkok" /><published>2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Taiwan-Can-Help-%E5%9C%A8%E6%9B%BC%E8%B0%B7</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Taiwan-Can-Help-%E5%9C%A8%E6%9B%BC%E8%B0%B7/">&lt;p&gt;🇹🇭 On October 21, I participated in the “Conference on Social Innovation and Civic Participation”, jointly organized by the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Representative Office in Thailand, the Faculty of Communication Arts of Chulalongkorn University and the German Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF). In addition to the Participation Officers of the National Development Council, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Construction Commission, there were also a representative from IISI International, Inc.; Johnson Liang, the co-founder of the Cofacts project; and a meteorologist, Dr. Chi-Ming Peng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 It is worth noting that the main contents of this seminar include Taiwan’s promotion of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the use of open-access materials to improve the quality of life, countering internet disinformation, and expanding citizen participation in public policy, and so on. Every item is the result of cooperation between government, business, and citizen communities. In other words, the focus of the discussion is not just “what we did”, but “how we did it together”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Taking social innovation as an example, I shared the story of the development of the Innovation Center; the social issues dealt with by the winners of the Presidential Hackathon winners of the past two years and the implementation of sustainable development goals; opening up a weekly Office Hour as well as touring town halls, minimizing the information gap between urban and rural areas;  and using the “Social Innovation Lab” to really grasp issues immediately by responding to social issues encountered by our friends, and letting social innovations drive regulatory innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎙️ In addition, thanks to the arrangements of the Representative Office, I took separate and in-depth interviews on the same day with the Thai Public Broadcasting Service, Chulalongkorn University, A DAY, Post Today, and Workpoint. It is readily apparent that Taiwan’s practical experience has received attention from across Thai society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 The section on citizen participation was presented by the Ministry of Foreign Affair’s Public Affairs section chief, Mr. Qian Muxian, and the Public Construction Commission committee member Mr. Zhang Zhaoqi. The presentation opened with the government’s four key values of “Transparency, Participation, Accountability, and Inclusion”, and then explaining the functions of the NDC Public Policy Network Participation Platform (JOIN), and then continuing to the inter-departmental openings of the government liaison system. “Requesting a National Airborne Service Corps at Hengchun Airport” and  “Using Tax-Income Software Leads to Blowups” are two examples of the network process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 They introduced the inter-departmental participation officers networks; how to clarify petitioner’ core demands; interviews with multiple stakeholders to collect opinions weekly; inviting service users to join in the process and participate in actual planning, and completing the meeting process and publicly responding to specific procedures to find feasible and innovative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 “Taiwan Can Help” is the core message of the government in recent years. This is not just a slogan, but a dependable experience and resource that can contribute internationally. With help from all sectors of Taiwan, I’m glad to see that this Bangkok trip proves yet again: Taiwan Can Help.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">The focus of the discussion is not just “what we did”, but “how we did it together”.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66f950eecd95b45469cbb174f3f7d4dee281c484.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66f950eecd95b45469cbb174f3f7d4dee281c484.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">All for one and one for all</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All for one and one for all" /><published>2019-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%8B-%E7%9C%BE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%A9%E4%B9%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗽 When I was in New York in September, I befriended &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kelbayar&quot;&gt;Kareem Elbayar&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership manager of the United Nations (UN). He introduced me to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ According to UN estimates, more than 130 million people from 42 countries worldwide are in need of humanitarian assistance this year. The cost is conservatively estimated to be US$21.9 billion. As of June this year, more than 70.80 million people have been displaced worldwide, an unprecedented historical high. In the presence of a huge and complex humanitarian crisis, a major challenge for all of us lies in how to provide immediate relief in the most critical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 Therefore, the HDX team decided to use “data for humanitarian assistance” to help define common standards for information, so that colleagues who work in humanitarian assistance everywhere can use the same tools to assess different situations. For the humanitarian aid work, which region and when do you need resources? A minor inaccuracy can lead to a significant miscalculation. By having complete information, we can ensure fast and accurate decisions to meet the actual needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 Currently, HDX has published more than 10,000 data sets in 250 regions around the world, which can be shared and accessed by everyone. In addition, HDX is committed to the development of Predictive Analytics for humanitarian aids. Everyone is invited to review the past and present data of the same region so that potential problems can be understood in advance to prevent crises before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 Using the same concept, Taiwan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.taiwan.gov.tw/index_en.aspx&quot;&gt;Civil IoT platform&lt;/a&gt; adopts the internationally standardized SensorThings API. For water resources, air quality, or even disaster prevention information, the world’s academic researchers and hands-on workers can get more comprehensive help through these openly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📒 Taiwan ranks among the best in the world in terms of transparency of government information. For example, the complete historical data of the government’s electronic procurement network has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gazette2.nat.gov.tw/EG_FileManager/eguploadpub/eg025179/ch06/type2/gov51/num12/Eg.htm&quot;&gt;made public to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt; this year, though this is not the case in most countries. Therefore, in the Presidential Hackathon in July this year, we collaborated with the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP). Many participating teams from various countries were inspired by the experiences of Taiwan for more good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/28/build-better-build-right-a-new-tool-for-sustainable-climate-resilient-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;CoST&lt;/a&gt; team led by Minister of Transparency of Honduras is actively using procurement materials to make environmental impact assessments more transparent and to resolve conflicts in economic development and public land use. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/23/cartelogy-a-tool-for-fair-competition-and-corruption-free-public-procurement-in-malaysia/&quot;&gt;Mentadak&lt;/a&gt; team from Malaysia also uses open procurement data standards to identify conflicts of interest in the procurement process. This reduces the possibility of fraud and helps good manufacturers participate in public construction. Both teams won the hackathon at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The success of Taiwan’s experience does not lie in the amount of information, but in the core spirit of social innovation - “all for one and one for all”.

Vitalik Buterin, who is a member on the RadicalxChange Foundation Council, and also the founder of Ethereum shared with us his experience with “Quadratic Voting” in the Presidential Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Some readers may have never heard of Ethereum or Vitalik. But that doesn’t matter — the focus of this article is to share my legal basis for serving on two nonprofit organizations , as something every civil servant can reference: RadicalxChange in the United States, and the Digital Future Society in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ First, according to Article 14(1), Article 14-2(1), and Article 14-3 of the Civil Service Act, a civil servant, stipulated by the law, may not concurrently hold a public employment or business; in the case of adjunct businesses or positions for nonprofit organizations, whether or not they are paid, permission should be requested from the service agency. In my case, it is necessary to obtain consent from the Premier of the Executive Yuan beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 As stipulated under Article 3 of the “Regulation Permitting the Paid Employment of Civil Servants in Non-Profit Businesses or Groups”, the nominated non-profit organizations must be “legally registered or filed and established with the authorizing department”. The problem is that when it comes to an “international” non-profit organization, the organization may not necessarily be registered or established in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Logically, the reasoning that “something is impermissible just because it is neither stipulated by nor has precedence under the law” is inconsistent with the government’s ethos of encouraging the innovative spirit of civil servants. For this reason, I have consulted my colleagues who specialize in the relevant law and submitted a confirmation request to the Ministry of Civil Service. The Ministry then indicated that there is no restriction that a non-profit organization must be registered in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🆗 As stipulated by Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the regulation, if the part-time job has a negative impact on their work, damages the image of the government or civil servant, has the potential for malpractice, or is incompatible with their duty, the organization shall not grant the permission. It is worth noting that although only the “paid” part is specified here, I still consider these two “unpaid” positions with the same criteria, confirming that not only do they not have the above concerns, but also help connect my domestic work with international orgnizations with the approval of the Premier. Moreover, I use my time outside of work to perform these two “unpaid” positions and give priority strictly to the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚀 In summary, considering these two “unpaid” positions, which are directly related to social innovation and open government, and with the consent from the Premier, I will continue to participate in RadicalxChange and the Digital Future Society as a member of the board. Along with the activities to increase the opportunity to promote our innovations in related fields globally, I also hope that this experience can be used as a case for Taiwan’s civil servants to invoke and refer to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">These two “unpaid” positions are directly related to social innovation and open government.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f50428cabfed29d9ff4add66e64ef83e8e167b41.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f50428cabfed29d9ff4add66e64ef83e8e167b41.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy" /><published>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗺 Democracy improves as more people participate. And digital technology remains one of the best ways to improve participation — as long as the focus is on finding common ground and creating consensus, not division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 These are lessons Taiwan has taken to heart in recent years, with the government and the tech community partnering to create online platforms and other digital initiatives that allow everyday citizens to propose and express their opinion on policy reforms. Today, Taiwan is crowdsourcing democracy to create a more responsive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌻 Fittingly, this movement, which today aims to increase government transparency, was born in a moment of national outrage over a lack of openness and accountability in politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 On March 18, 2014, hundreds of young activists, most of them college students, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-legislature/taiwan-students-occupy-legislature-over-china-trade-deal-idUSBREA2I04S20140319&quot;&gt;occupied Taiwan’s legislature&lt;/a&gt; to express their profound opposition to a new trade pact with Beijing then under consideration, as well as the secretive manner in which it was being pushed through Parliament by the Kuomintang, the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔍 Catalyzing what came to be known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/02/activist-legacy-of-taiwan-s-sunflower-movement-pub-76966&quot;&gt;Sunflower Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the protesters demanded that the pact be scraped and that the government institute a more transparent ratification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚧 The occupation, which drew widespread public support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/students-prepare-to-end-occupation-of-taiwans-legislature/?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised greater legislative oversight of the trade pact. (To this day, the pact has yet to be approved by Taiwan’s legislature.) A poll released after the occupation, however, showed that 76 percent of the nation remained dissatisfied with the Kuomintang government, illustrating the crisis of trust caused by the trade deal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 To heal this rift and communicate better with everyday citizens, the administration reached out to a group of civic-minded hackers and coders, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://g0v.asia/&quot;&gt;g0v&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “gov-zero”), who had been seeking to improve government transparency through the creation of open-source tools. The organization had come to the attention of the government during the Sunflower occupation, when g0v hackers had worked closely with the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 In December 2014, Jaclyn Tsai, a government minister focused on digital technology, attended a g0v-sponsored hackathon and proposed the establishment of a neutral platform where various online communities could exchange policy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 Several contributors from g0v responded by partnering with the government to start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vtaiwan.tw&quot;&gt;vTaiwan&lt;/a&gt; platform in 2015. VTaiwan (which stands for “virtual Taiwan”) brings together representatives from the public, private and social sectors to debate policy solutions to problems primarily related to the digital economy. Since it began, vTaiwan has tackled 30 issues, relying on a mix of online debate and face-to-face discussions with stakeholders. Though the government is not obligated to follow vTaiwan’s recommendations (a policy that may soon change), the group’s work often leads to concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 VTaiwan partly relies on a unique digital tool known as Pol.is to ensure its crowdsourced policy debates remain civil and reach consensus. Using Pol.is, any vTaiwan participant can post a comment about the topic or policy being discussed. Crucially, other users cannot directly reply to these statements, which reduces the likelihood of trolling and abuse. Instead, they can click “agree,” “disagree” or “pass/unsure” on each comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Using real-time machine learning, Pol.is analyzes all the votes on the comments to produce an interactive map that groups like-minded participants together in relation to other, differently minded users. The map lays bare the gaps between various groups — as well as any areas of agreement. Ideally, this incentivizes people to post comments that attract more supporters, creating a path toward consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 VTaiwan has been used to solve a number of particularly thorny digital policy problems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b&quot;&gt;In 2015&lt;/a&gt;, it helped break an impasse over how best to regulate Uber, which had arrived in Taiwan two years earlier prompting opposition from taxi drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 In 2016, hundreds of ordinary citizens using the platform managed within a few weeks to come up with new regulations for online liquor sales, after multiyear discussions among business and social groups had broken down. And in 2018, vTaiwan helped to create new regulations for the platform economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Taiwan also relies on another civic engagement platform called Join, this one maintained entirely by the government. Though similar to vTaiwan in that it uses Pol.is to create consensus, Join tackles matters beyond the digital economy, such as vacancy taxes and drug prescriptions for animals. Compared to the hundreds of thousands who have debated issues on vTaiwan, Join’s website has hosted 10.6 million unique visitors — almost half of Taiwan’s population — since it began in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Together, vTaiwan and Join are opening up more direct lines of communication between Taiwan’s government and its citizens, producing tremendous benefits for the former. Officials are exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking, while identifying core public service demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 The &lt;a href=&quot;https://presidential-hackathon.taiwan.gov.tw/en/&quot;&gt;Presidential Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; is yet another tech initiative bringing Taiwan’s public, private and social sectors together to solve urgent problems. At the event, the first of which was held last year, teams of hackers — composed of either private citizens or government workers — compete to design the most innovative improvements to the nation’s public services. Instead of prize money, the best teams receive a promise from the government that it will apply their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖ One of the top teams in this year’s hackathon included officials from the Judicial Yuan, the judicial branch of the Taiwanese government. The team developed two digital tools to make the nation’s judicial system more legible and transparent for everyday Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚔 Drunken driving is an issue of broad public concern in Taiwan. And in recent years, the differing sentences handed out to drivers involved in high-profile accidents have led to public confusion about why some punishments can be so light compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔧 One of the digital tools developed by the Judicial Yuan team addresses this confusion by giving the public a better sense of why punishments can differ for the same crime. Any user can simply enter in the relevant data for a hypothetical drunken-driving offense, such as blood alcohol concentration and the type of vehicle involved. The application then lists the appropriate penalties for the case, while also showing sentences from real-world drunken-driving cases that are similar to the one described. (The team analyzed over 50,000 verdicts from previous drunken-driving offenses to create the tool.) In this way, users get a better understanding of how slight changes in, for example, blood alcohol concentration can lead to radically different penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 In the closing speech of this year’s Presidential Hackathon, President Tsai Ing-wen encouraged government officials to embrace a hacker spirit as they work to meet the public’s needs. “Do it bravely; dare to make mistakes,” she said. In Taiwan, digital technology is boosting civic dialogue and infusing government with the spirit of social innovation. By giving everyone a voice, Taiwan is strengthening its democracy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In Taiwan, online platforms powered by artificial intelligence are giving citizens a chance to have their say — while keeping the trolls at bay.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan" /><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/">&lt;p&gt;🆕 I would like to share with you the good news: The 3rd Asia-Pacific Social Enterprise Summit will be held in Taoyuan in early May 2020. The organizer is Impact Hub Taipei, with authorization by the SME Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 The last two summits were held in Taichung and Kaohsiung respectively. Not only did they attract thousands of highly enthusiastic and experienced people from all over the world, but also through the continuous hosting of the summit, the summits gave participants from other countries the opportunity to learn about contributions from Taiwan. At the same time, the summits gave the domestic population with the same ambitions and hope to have a platform for communications and discussions, so as to solve specific social issues and to promote sustainable development through innovative business models and business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Of course, the most important aspect of hosting an international event is the local connections. In late September, MOEA colleagues and I, accompanying the organizers of the summit, met with Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan to seek administrative support from the city government. In addition to the promise of the Mayor Cheng regarding the support of the projects related to the venue of the summit, transportation connection, and enterprise connection, Mayor Cheng very efficiently formed an inter-departmental coordination group. He also introduced in detail the government’s assistance to the social enterprises, and suggested that the organizers could include more local elements of Taoyuan in the peripheral activities of the summit such as “social enterprise tours” and “social enterprise market.” It is worth expecting these elements in next year’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 Moreover, in order to promote the 17 sustainable development goals and implement the overall policy objectives of “friendly and kind, suitable to live and work,” Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the sustainable development goals in the region with actual data and cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 In fact, according to the statistics indicators of the counties and cities of the Ministry of the Interior in 2018, the total birth rate of Taoyuan City is not only the highest in the six municipalities, but also one of the highest in the country, second only to the Lianjiang County. In addition, Taoyuan is the city with the highest net migration rate in Taiwan and the highest rate of social increase. These figures not only represent the achievements of Taoyuan in recent years, but also the foundation for promoting social innovation in the future. We look forward to Taoyuan’s contributions as a demonstration for all counties and cities in Taiwan, so we can flourish together toward the goals of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、黃子維</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the SDGs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Safeguarding Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safeguarding Taiwan" /><published>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;🛡️ Taiwan is home to more than 23 million people. One point on which all agree is the importance of safeguarding national security. In the past, related policymaking was the exclusive domain of the government. Today, the people can help shape this critically important process by participating in the on-going &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The Digital Dialogues are part of the AIT@40 campaign launched by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Digital Innovation Space in an effort to help digitally democratize the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  They are, according to AIT, “the first of its kind anywhere in the world  – a public forum to discuss the results of an artificial intelligence-enabled digital dialogue between a foreign mission and a local community on how to tackle a pressing foreign policy challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 They comprise four online public consultations this year on Taiwan’s role in global society, April; U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial exchanges, June; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, August; and people-to-people ties, November.  As AIT Director Brent Christensen said, “AIT is interested in what you, the public, have to say on these matters.  We hope these dialogues will provide valuable insights that AIT can put into practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛩️ Those interested in learning more about why Taiwan is purchasing advanced weapons like the F-16 C/D Block 70 fighters and M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as the reasons for closer U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, must take part in any discussions on the bilateral security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important security ally and partner. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan vote of support. It states that the U.S. government should provide “defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.” This ensures the U.S. supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining robust self-defense capabilities while consolidating national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ Since 2008, the U.S. has sold defensive weapons worth more than US$24 billion to Taiwan—an amount underscoring the strength of two-way ties. In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔜 AIT has said the AIT@40 Digital Dialogues for 2019 are not the end of the road for this revolutionary participatory policymaking initiative. They intend to continue to engage in future digital dialogues on the U.S-Taiwan relationship, including for the drafting of the Talent Circulation Alliance White Paper, which will become part of AmCham’s influential annual White Paper.

&lt;p&gt;📜 Professor Fang asked this question because the Department of Commerce announced the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” in August this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Last year, the “Corporation Law” was amended to include the conditions for company establishment, and added “the company’s actions to promote public interest.” Social enterprises that take into account their social responsibility and market operations can register as a company and voluntarily expose the charter to solve the problem in the past that profit and mission are unable to balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ However, in the social enterprise ecosystem, organizations with various forms also hoping that each other’s missions and  results can be more clearly disclosed in public. Therefore, when the amendment to the “Company Law” was passed, the Legislature  attached a resolution requesting the government to discuss how to respond to the needs of these friends within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇪🇨 To this end, many friends are actively seeking methods and providing advice. In March, I met with William H. Clark, Jr., the main promoter of the Common Law Act in the United States. He shared the case of Ecuador and provided a reference for Taiwan: that is, first proposing administrative rules and experimenting for a while, then form a formal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The advantage of “administrative rules” is that organizers who are committed to social innovation can proactively expose their charters, missions, and public interest reports without penalties. Not only to protect the current legal mechanism, but also let relevant companies refer to the results during the trial, and then decide how to form the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, we wrote the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” as a pilot point. Any type of organization can be registered as a social creation organization. The purpose is to enable any friend who is interested in social innovation to find a partner by log into the platform and expand social innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏫  So, can private universities turn into social innovation organizations? My answer is: “Of course!” Private colleges and universities, as long as they are registered in the organization type under the “financial corporation”, they can be regarded as a “business oriented financial corporation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 Over the years, whether it is the Ministry of Education’s “U-start Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program” or the “University Social Responsibility Practice Program” (USR), the creativity and vitality demonstrated by the teachers and students have fully demonstrated the spirit of social innovation: “everyone’s business, everyone helps.” As a organizer, colleges and universities will also develop closer partnerships for the practice of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The registration for the Cultural University has just completed. I hope that in the future, both public and private higher education institutions will be able to log in together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://si.taiwan.gov.tw&quot;&gt;si.taiwan.gov.tw&lt;/a&gt; platform and become fellow organizations to empower social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
